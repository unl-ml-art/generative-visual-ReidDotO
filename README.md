# Project 3 Generative Visual

Reid Brockmeier, rbrockmeier2@unl.edu

## Abstract

For this project, I want to use a GAN to generate pokemon, and use the generated images to create a custom ROM Hack of Pokemon with those as the sprites. Ideally, I would like to replace every Pokemon in one game, but I am not sure if that is possible within the time restraints. As far as the method for generating, I am not entirely sure, but I believe there is a way to train/refine a GAN on your own images. If it is possible, I would like to use all the Pokemon to train it on. If not, I am sure that style transfer could work as well. An alternative project could be generating thumbnails for YouTube, but I do not think that would be all that interesting.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- Pokemon Data
  - [GPT-2 Notebook](https://github.com/unl-ml-art/generative-visual-ReidDotO/blob/master/Pokemon%20Data/gpt2-generate-finetune.ipynb)
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
