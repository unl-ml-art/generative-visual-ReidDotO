## Abstract

For this project, I created a ROM hack of Pokemon FireRed with all of the Pokemon replaced with AI generated versions. The appearences of the Pokemon were generated using a Google Collab notebook from Max Woolf that makes use of ruDALL-E. This notebook was unedited by me, and was trained on all existing Pokemon. The Names, stats, and Pokedex entries were generated by GPT-2 using a text file containing the data for all existing Pokemon. The real challenge here was implementing these into an actual playable game. The process is very time consuming and tedious, and is outlined in Technical Notes below. I am happy with my end result, in that I was able to succeed in creating an actual playable game with AI generated Pokemon. The game is not technically complete because there are over 400 total Pokemon to replace, but all Pokemon encounterable before the post game have been replaced. It is truly surprising to see just how well the generated Pokemon sprites are, and I am thankful that a trained model already existed. I look forward to expiramenting more with DALL-E in the future, as it seems to be the leader in image generation.

## Model/Data

- Pokemon Data

## Technical Notes

TO PLAY THIS ROM YOU MUST RECREATE IT:
1. Obtain a ROM of Pokemon FireRed (no I will not explain how to do this)
2. Download [Pokemon Game Editor](https://github.com/Gamer2020/PokemonGameEditor/releases)
3. Launch PGE and open your ROM
4. Select "Pokemon Editor"
5. Import All Pokemon- use [Game Files.zip - Pokemon](https://github.com/unl-ml-art/generative-visual-ReidDotO/blob/master/Game%20Files.zip)
6. Import All Sprite Sheets- use [Game Files.zip - Sprites](https://github.com/unl-ml-art/generative-visual-ReidDotO/blob/master/Game%20Files.zip)
7. Play on an Emulator of your choice

TO MAKE YOUR OWN POKEMON (this takes way too long, so I do not suggest doing it):
1. Generate Pokemon sprites using [Collab Notebook from Max Woolf](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A3t2gQofQGeXo5z1BAr1zqYaqVg3czKd?usp=sharing)
2. Generate Pokemon data using [GPT-2 Notebook](https://github.com/unl-ml-art/generative-visual-ReidDotO/blob/master/Pokemon%20Data/gpt2-generate-finetune.ipynb)
3. Use [Pokemon Game Editor](https://github.com/Gamer2020/PokemonGameEditor/releases) to manually enter names, stats and other Pokemon data
4. Using your generated Pokemon sprites, you must do some work in photoshop to index them and use the correct format.
   1. Export the first sprite sheet and use this as a template.
   2. Cut your generated pokemon out of the background and place them in the spots of the existing Pokemon.
   3. Take some liberties for the back sprites as they are not generated.
   4. Make a background layer that is a color that does not appear in the sprite itself.
   5. Go to Image, Mode, and select Indexed Color.
   6. Change the colors to a custom profile and use 16 or less colors.
   7. Make sure that the first indexed color is your background color.
   8. Save as a png with the smallest file size.
   9. Import A-series Sprite sheet in PGE.
